tmxlite
-------

A lightweight C++14 parsing library for tmx map files created with the Tiled
map editor. Requires no external linking, all dependencies are included.
Supports tmx maps up to 0.18 with CSV, zlib and base64 compression. The parser
is renderer agnostic, and is cross platform on Windows, linux and OS X. It 
has also been successfully built for Android too.

As the library contains no specific rendering functions some example projects
are included, along with the relevant CMake files. These are meant
mostly for guidance and are not 100% optimised, but should get you off on the right
foot when using libraries such as SFML or SDL2/OpenGL. Examples for any specific
rendering library are welcome via a pull request.

##### Building
Either use the included Visual Studio project file if you are on Windows
or the CMake file to generate project files for your compiler of choice. tmxlite
can be built as both static or shared libraries, or simply include the source
files in your own project.
